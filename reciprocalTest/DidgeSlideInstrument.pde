/* This instrument simulates a didgeridoo with a moving length.
 * The wavelength (lambda) of the note played by a didgeridoo is approximately
 * four times the length (L) of the didgeridoo.  Freqency (f) is found by
 * from the following formula using the approximate speed of sound in air (c).
 * f = c / lambda
 * This means that as the length of the didgeridoo increases linearly,
 * the frequency of the tone will decrease inversely.  This descent is
 * not linear, abviously.
